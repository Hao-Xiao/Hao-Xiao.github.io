This is the front page of my personal website powered by [Academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).

Who Am I?
------
My name is Hao Xiao (肖昊) and currently I am a math-majored senior undergraduate enrolled in the class of 2019 at School of Mathematical Sciences, [Soochow University](http://www.suda.edu.cn). My academic interest focuses on Geometry & Algebra and is then followed by Analysis & Theoretical Physics. I am heading for graduate program of pure math in Fall 2019.

What Am I Doing Currently?
------
1. Applying pure math graduate program.
2. Struggling for two researches (refer to the research section in my [CV](http://Hao-Xiao.github.io/cv/) for details) and following my reading schedule (see below).

What Is My Career Goal and Plan?
------
I am not very sure about the long term plan and goal since pure mathematics and theoretical physics is a huge family consisting of a salvo of different subfields and I am still a very beginner to some extent. While most classmates have already chosen their future research topics in math, CS, statistics, etc., yet for me there might be one or two more years before settling down in a specific subfield. So for the present it is better to focus on the short term plan and goal. Now that I have earned enough credits for being finished with bachelor degree then, I decide to read through some advanced topics in geometry, algebra, analysis, and physics in order to achieve a strong base of pure math and theoretical physics. And here goes the one-year plan:
