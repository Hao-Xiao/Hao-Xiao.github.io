This is the front page of my personal website powered by [Academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).

Who Am I?
------
My name is Hao Xiao (肖昊) and currently I am a math-majored senior undergraduate enrolled in the class of 2019 at School of Mathematical Sciences, [Soochow University](http://www.suda.edu.cn). My academic interest focuses on Geometry & Algebra and is then followed by Analysis & Theoretical Physics. I am heading for graduate program of pure math or theoretical physics in Fall 2019.

What Am I Doing Currently?
------
1. Applying pure math or mathematical physics graduate program.
2. Carrying on two researches (refer to the research section in my [CV](http://Hao-Xiao.github.io/cv/) for details).
3. Following my reading schedule (see below).

Why Do I Choose Mathematics?
------
Literature was my favorite. My mother reads one book for every two or three weeks since I was able to remember things (but I do not know when she actually started the routine), and it is astonishing that she keeps it even nowadays. She reads love stories, social comments, popular novels, and sometimes serious literature. Recently she is on _Shiroi Kyotō (白い巨塔)_ by Toyoko Yamasaki. As a kid, I initially just copied what the adults were doing before truly understanding the content of the books and the meaning of doing so. One or two years from single imitating, the real and serious appreciation for literature forms. This favoritism is also partially influenced by my grandparents. I wrote over ten thousands of pages when in middle school. I tried short novels, poems, and essays.

The turning point was Euclid's _Elements_. Euclidean geometry is taught in my middle school with the focus mainly on problem solving. At the end the course, you probably attains a fancy grade in the exam but fails to understand what axioms are, how axiomatic system works, why Euclid's construction is important, and how it influences mathematics for centuries. I searched on the Internet for the origin and history of Euclidean geometry and then I knew Euclid's _Elements_. The first four chapters entirely reshaped my mind. The charm of axiomatic system and the beauty of logical reasoning within this framework are fascinating enough to a middle school guy. Hereafter, I switched to mathematics (and physics partially) and kept pursuing it till now.

What Is My Career Goal and Plan?
------
I am not very sure about the long term plan and goal since pure mathematics and theoretical physics is a huge family consisting of a salvo of different subfields and I am still a very beginner to some extent. While most classmates have already chosen their future research topics in math, CS, statistics, etc., yet for me there might be one or two more years before settling down in a specific subfield. So for the present it is better to focus on the short term plan and goal. Now that I have earned enough credits for being finished with bachelor degree then, I decide to read through some advanced topics in geometry, algebra, analysis, and physics in order to achieve a strong base of pure math and theoretical physics. And here goes the one-year plan:
