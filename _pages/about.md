Who Am I?

My name is Hao Xiao (肖昊) and currently I am a math-majored senior undergraduate enrolled in the class of 2019 in School of Mathematical Sciences, [Soochow University](http://www.suda.edu.cn). My academic interest focuses on Geometry & Algebra and is then followed by Analysis & Theoretical Physics. I am heading for graduate program of pure math in Fall 2019.
